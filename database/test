These interconnected volumes form a seamless and flowing architectural language, with soft curves and elliptical forms that contrast the city’s traditionally rectilinear planning. Designed to reflect the dynamism of 21st-century urban life, Galaxy SOHO integrates retail, office, and public spaces. The design draws inspiration from traditional Chinese courtyards but transforms them using advanced parametric design and smooth white aluminum and glass surfaces. The result is an ultra-modern structure that captures movement and openness, serving both aesthetic and functional purposes. The complex is a commercial and cultural symbol of Beijing’s architectural evolution.These interconnected volumes form a seamless and flowing architectural language, with soft curves and elliptical forms that contrast the city’s traditionally rectilinear planning.
